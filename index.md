# An introduction to reactive programming

Welcome to studying reactive programming.

## When to use reactive programming – a checklist

* Your program models asynchronous phenomena
* Your program is easy to think in terms of events
* You would like to refine low-level events into high-level user interfaces

## When *not* to use reactive programming – another checklist

* Your program does not interact with the user's input devices such as keyboard
  or mouse
* Your program is not depend on network events such as WebSocket messages
* Your team does not have time or motivation to study a new programming style

## Next: streams

Reactive programming is a high-level concept. It does not say anything definite
about implementation.

Next, let's look at the [stream](streams.html) abstraction, which provides us a way of
implementing reactive programming.
